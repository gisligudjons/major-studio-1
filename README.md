The goal here is to show the use of wigs in a creative timeline manner that also shows the scale of use. Wigs were at one time a sign of 
wealth and prosperiety, and of social class. A fascinating look at the combination of fashion and class distinction. Spiral Plots like these are versatile way of showing showing fairly large data sets, usually to show trends over a large time period.
The data set is not very large, but large enough. About 140 points.

The goal here is to visualize where the artifacts in the african art museum and asian art museum come from. The dataset is very large, with about 5000 datapoints, 
and therefore could the visualization also work as a sort of heatmap of where the most artifacts come from. Time could also be a dimension.

Picture 3: "Relative Age Effect in Portraits"

The goal here is to visualize where each subject of a portait was born in a calendar year. Relative age effect refers to the phenomenon by which children born early in their year of birth perform more highly than children born later in the year. The calendar could be interactive in a way, it could show information about the date when pressed or similar. Work in Progress!
